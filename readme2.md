# What Is Internet And How Does It Work?
In this readme file we will be understanding what is Internet and how it actually works, and how you are able to consume content from the web by sitting somewhere in some corner of the world.
## What is Internet?
The Internet is nothing but a global network of computers, which can communicate with each other by sending or recieving data and information.
So basically, it is a network for sharing information between devices.
Internet allows you to play games, visit websites, watch videos and many more things.
## How does Internet work?
The internet is accessed by almost each and everyone in the world in this generation.Your device, say laptop mobile or any other device is firstly connected either to the mobile cellular data or the wifi router nearby.The signals from your device to the router travels in the form of 0s and 1s. then this binary digits are converted into laser pulses and sent through optical fibres to the main internet state provider.These ISPs are nothing but huge buildings with lots of cables from routers across the place. Several ISPs are connected to each other and are connected across countries again, using optical fibres lying under the sea water, going between mountains and etc.. <br>
So basically the data from your device in the form of radio signals is then converted to binary laser signals to the ISPs and then given to the target user's router in the form of laser pulses again and the converted to radio signals to reach his device and that radio signals get converted to viewable data of the required type so the user can watch it.
<br>This is the very basic understanding of how internet works.
