## How does a browser work?
 A browser is a software application that allows users to access and interact with websites on the Internet. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the web. When a user types a web address like google.com into the browser, the browser first checks its local cache to see if any information related to that website is already stored. If not found, it contacts the Internet Service Provider (ISP), which helps route the request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server. The DNS server acts like the internet’s phonebook, converting the domain name into an IP address that computers can understand. Once the IP address is retrieved, the browser establishes a connection with the web server using networking protocols such as TCP/IP, and then sends a request to load the webpage. The server responds by sending back website data, usually in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other files. The browser then processes this information — it parses the HTML to build the page structure, applies styles from the CSS, runs JavaScript to enable interactivity, and finally renders the complete webpage visually on the screen. Any interaction made by the user, like clicking a button or typing in a form, triggers further communication between the browser and the server, following the same process in the background.
